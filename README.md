School and Students Performance Analysis
This code begins with an overall analysis, providing a comprehensive view of the educational landscape. It merges two datasets: one containing general school information and the other detailing individual student data, including their performance in reading, math, and overall scores. The analysis is then divided into several sections:

Data Overview: After reading and merging the datasets, the code presents key general information about the sample, covering school-level data such as budgets and types, as well as student performance metrics.

Highest and Lowest-Performing Schools: The code identifies and analyzes the highest and lowest-performing schools based on various performance metrics.

Grade-Level Insights: The third section offers performance insights by different grade levels, highlighting any grade-specific trends or patterns.

Budget-Related Analysis: The code conducts calculations and comparisons based on school spending, exploring the potential impact of budget allocation on student performance.

School Size Impact: Similar to the budget analysis, the code investigates whether school size has any significant impact on student performance.

This code aims to provide a well-rounded analysis, with a comprehensive overall view at the beginning, followed by in-depth insights into various factors influencing school performance.
